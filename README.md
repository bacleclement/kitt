# Kitt — Kitt Intelligence and Tooling Toolkit

> "I don't transform into a car, but I will scan your entire codebase in seconds." — KITT

Kitt is a reusable AI workflow engine for Claude Code. It provides a complete spec-driven development pipeline with pluggable integrations for any task manager, VCS, and design tool.

---

## What Kitt Gives You

- **Full workflow pipeline:** brainstorm → refine → align → build-plan → implement → code-review → finish
- **App-scoped context:** monorepo support — load only relevant agents and standards per app/service
- **Automated code review:** diff-against-spec review with 5 quality dimensions before every PR
- **Session analytics:** token costs, feedback tracking, skill effectiveness, spec drift scoring
- **Systematic debugging:** reproduce → locate → root cause → fix → regress
- **Frontend & backend QA:** browser scenarios + HTTP scenarios, live run file, multi-stakeholder review columns
- **Developer onboarding:** role-aware guide generated from your actual codebase
- **Pluggable adapters:** Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues, Local / GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket / report to Local or Notion
- **Smart setup wizard:** scans your repo, detects apps, asks one question at a time with lettered options
- **Zero hardcoding:** all platform config lives in `kitt.json`

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `setup` | First-time config wizard — or join mode for new team members. Detects monorepo apps for scoped context. |
| `onboard` | Personalized onboarding guide (role interview → scoped codebase tour) |
| `brainstorm` | Explore raw ideas → design.md before any spec or ticket |
| `orchestrate` | Routes work to the right next step based on current state. Detects scope per work item in multi-app projects. |
| `refine` | Constraint discovery: functional, access, NFRs. Epic mode generates spec with US breakdown |
| `align` | Validates spec against DDD / Clean Architecture |
| `build-plan` | Breaks spec into implementable TDD tasks |
| `implement` | Implements tasks with TDD — sequential or subagent mode. Session logging for analytics. |
| `tdd` | Red-Green-Refactor cycle — called by implement on every task |
| `verify` | Evidence before completion claims — no exceptions |
| `code-review` | Automated 5-dimension review (spec compliance, architecture, standards, agents, quality). Runs before finish-development. |
| `debug` | Systematic bug investigation: reproduce → root cause → fix → regress |
| `capture-rule` | Turns corrections into permanent rules. Scope-aware: feature → app → repo → company destinations. |
| `session-review` | Post-completion analytics: time distribution, token costs, feedback log, skill effectiveness, agent freshness. |
| `qa-frontend` | Browser-based QA: scenario generation from spec/Jira, live `qa-run.md` with AI/Dev/PM/Design columns, publishes to Local or Notion |
| `qa-backend` | HTTP scenario runner: API credentials, request/response assertions, live run file, same report adapter |
| `manage-task` | Ticket CRUD (read, create, transition, comment) |
| `branch-creator` | Git branch from ticket key |
| `pr-creator` | PR creation with task manager linking |
| `vcs/worktree` | Creates isolated git worktree outside the repo — called by orchestrate when user wants isolation |
| `finish-development` | End-of-work sequence: verify → push → PR → ticket transition → worktree cleanup |
| `vcs/worktree-finish` | Removes a worktree properly after PR is merged — called by finish-development |

---

## Workflow

All work starts with `/orchestrate`. It detects the current state and routes to the right skill.

### Use Case 1 — Raw idea (no ticket, no spec)

```
raw idea
  └─ /orchestrate
       ├─ branch or worktree? → choose work environment
       ├─ needs exploration? → /brainstorm → design.md → /orchestrate
       └─ scope clear?
            ├─ Epic  → /refine (EPIC MODE) → spec + ## User Stories
            │            └─ for each US: /align → /build-plan → /implement → /code-review → /finish-development
            ├─ Feature M  → /build-plan → /implement → /code-review → /finish-development
            └─ Feature S  → /implement → /code-review → /finish-development
```

### Use Case 2 — PM creates a ticket (epic with or without US)

```
ticket key
  └─ /orchestrate (reads ticket via adapter)
       ├─ branch or worktree? → choose work environment
       ├─ multi-app? → detect scope (from ticket or ask) → store in metadata.json
       ├─ US belongs to existing epic? → nest under epic folder, update children
       ├─ Epic, no US yet  → /refine (EPIC MODE) → extract US subfolders
       └─ Epic, US in TM   → import US from task manager
            └─ for each US: /align → /build-plan → /implement → /code-review → /finish-development
```

### Use Case 3 — Known feature or refactor

```
known scope
  └─ /orchestrate (ask size)
       ├─ branch or worktree? → choose work environment
       ├─ S (1-3 files, obvious)  → /implement → /code-review → /finish-development
       ├─ M (clear, < 2 days)     → /build-plan → /implement → /code-review → /finish-development
       └─ L (unclear or risky)    → /refine → /align → /build-plan → /implement → /code-review → /finish-development
```

### Use Case 4 — Bug

```
bug reported
  └─ /orchestrate
       ├─ branch or worktree? → choose work environment
       ├─ root cause unknown  → /debug → /finish-development
       ├─ quick fix           → /implement → /code-review → /finish-development
       └─ complex fix         → /build-plan → /implement → /code-review → /finish-development
```

### Use Case 5 — QA

```
feature ready for QA
  └─ /orchestrate
       ├─ frontend feature  → /qa-frontend → qa-run.md → publish (Local or Notion)
       └─ backend feature   → /qa-backend  → qa-run.md → publish (Local or Notion)
```

### Use Case 6 — Post-Completion Review

```
epic or feature completed
  └─ /orchestrate detects completion
       └─ /session-review → review.md (metrics, feedback log, token costs, improvements)
```

---

### Workspace Structure

Workspaces use **human-readable folder names**: `{ticketKey}-{slug}` (e.g., `PROJ-42-user-profile`) or just `{slug}` for work without tickets.

```
.claude/workspace/epics/PROJ-42-company-management/
├── metadata.json              # status, scope, children list
├── company-management-design.md
├── company-management-spec.md # from refine — contains ## User Stories
├── session-log.jsonl          # session events for analytics
├── PROJ-43-company-creation/
│   ├── company-creation-spec.md
│   └── company-creation-plan.md
└── PROJ-44-contact-management/
    ├── contact-management-spec.md
    └── contact-management-plan.md
```

---

## Context Architecture

Kitt organizes knowledge in two dimensions:

- **Domain context** (`product.md`) — business rules, users, vocabulary. Always loaded, never scoped.
- **Tech context** — shared conventions (`code-standards.md`) + per-scope deep expertise (agents colocated in the codebase).

```
.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md                       # Entry point, hard rules
├── context/
│   ├── product.md                  # Domain: business rules, users, vocabulary (always loaded)
│   └── code-standards.md           # Shared tech: baseline stack, naming, formatting (always loaded)
└── config/kitt.json                # scopes = the ONLY agent mapping

# Agents live in the codebase, colocated with the code they describe:
apps/api/services/network/agents/   # NestJS + hexagonal + DDD + network domain
apps/front/admin/AGENT.md           # React + MUI + admin UI patterns
```

### App-Scoped Context (Monorepo Support)

For monorepos with multiple apps, kitt loads **only relevant agents** per work item.

1. **Setup** detects apps (Nx, pnpm workspaces, Turbo), scans for colocated agents, auto-creates them if missing
2. **Orchestrate** detects or asks which app a work item touches, stores scope in `metadata.json`
3. **All skills** load: repo-wide context + repo-wide agents (`"*"` scope) + scoped agents only

### Configuration in kitt.json

```json
{
  "scopes": {
    "*": {
      "agents": ["docs/testing/integration-patterns.md"]
    },
    "api-network": {
      "path": "apps/api/services/network",
      "agents": ["apps/api/services/network/agents/**"]
    },
    "front-admin": {
      "path": "apps/front/admin",
      "agents": ["apps/front/admin/AGENT.md"]
    }
  }
}
```

- `"*"` scope = repo-wide agents, always loaded
- Named scopes = loaded only when that scope is active
- No `scopes` section = fallback to `glob **/agents/` (backward compatible, single-app projects)

### Context Loading Order

```
1. Repo-wide context:  .claude/context/product.md, code-standards.md (always)
2. Repo-wide agents:   kitt.json.scopes["*"].agents (always, if defined)
3. Scoped agents:      kitt.json.scopes.{scope}.agents (when scope is active)
4. Feature context:    workspace/{key}/spec ## Implementation Notes (if exists)
```

---

## Code Review

`/code-review` runs automatically before `/finish-development`. Reviews the diff against **5 dimensions:**

1. **Spec compliance** — all acceptance criteria met?
2. **Architecture alignment** — layer boundaries, DDD rules, patterns
3. **Code standards** — naming, imports, formatting from `code-standards.md`
4. **Agent doc compliance** — domain-specific rules from loaded agents
5. **Quality & maintainability** — dead code, error handling, test coverage, performance, security

Output: structured review with blockers (must fix), suggestions, spec compliance checklist, and verdict (PASS / PASS WITH SUGGESTIONS / BLOCKED).

---

## Session Review & Analytics

`/session-review` runs after epic or feature completion. Analyzes the development session:

- **Time distribution** per skill and per task
- **Token usage & cost** (per skill, per task, with model-based pricing)
- **Feedback log** with full user correction content and recurring pattern detection
- **Skill effectiveness** (verify pass rate, debug triggers, TDD cycles)
- **Spec accuracy score** (how many corrections = how good was the spec?)
- **Agent usage per scope** with freshness detection (flags 30+ day stale agents)

Skills emit lightweight events to `session-log.jsonl` during execution. Session-review aggregates them into `{key}-review.md`.

---

## Feedback Propagation

When you correct kitt mid-implementation ("no, use X pattern instead"):

1. Fix is applied immediately
2. Rule is optionally captured via `/capture-rule` (scope-aware: feature → app → repo → company)
3. Constraint is appended to `spec.md` under `## Implementation Notes`
4. Inline note added to `plan.md` on the affected task: `> ⚠️ Updated: {what changed}`
5. Event logged to `session-log.jsonl` for session-review analytics

Specs and plans stay synchronized with implementation decisions.

---

## Implementation Modes

When `/implement` starts, it asks which execution mode you want:

```
A) Subagent — parallel tasks within each phase, checkpoint between phases
B) Sequential — one task at a time, full visibility
```

**Sequential (B):** Default. Kitt implements each task in order — TDD cycle, validation, commit, then asks for your review before moving to the next.

**Subagent (A):** Kitt dispatches parallel subagents for tasks within the same phase. Between phases, it shows a summary + diff and waits for go/stop.

---

## Project Configuration (`kitt.json`)

`.claude/config/kitt.json` is the single source of truth. Every skill reads it — nothing is hardcoded.

    "name": "my-project",
    "description": "What this project does"
  },

## Adopting Kitt (First Person on a Project)

### Step 1: Install kitt on your machine (once)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bacleclement/kitt.git ~/.claude/kitt
```

### Step 2: Configure your project

Open Claude Code in your project root and run:

```
/setup
```

Kitt scans your repo and walks you through configuration one question at a time. For monorepos, it detects apps and configures scoped context. It writes:
- `.claude/config/kitt.json` — task manager, VCS, build commands, scopes
- `.claude/context/` — product knowledge, tech stack, code standards

**Commit these files.** They're the shared foundation every skill reads.

### Step 3: Work

```
/orchestrate
```

---

## New Team Member? (Project Already Configured)

### Step 1: Install kitt on your machine (once)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bacleclement/kitt.git ~/.claude/kitt
```

### Step 2: Open Claude Code and run

```
/setup
```

Kitt detects the existing config and switches to **join mode** — no wizard, no re-configuration. It recreates your local symlinks and hands off to `/onboard` for your personalized guide.

---

## Updating Kitt

```bash
git -C ~/.claude/kitt pull
```

Symlinks pick up the new version instantly. Nothing to commit in your project.
